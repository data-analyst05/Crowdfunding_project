# Crowdfunding Platforms Analysis

## Overview
Crowdfunding platforms, such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, have seen significant growth since their inception in the late aughts. These platforms have become a staple for creators ranging from indie enthusiasts to renowned celebrities looking to bring their ideas to life. However, not every campaign launched finds success.

## Data Analysis Tool
For this project, the analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel.

## Objective
The aim was to discern the variability in the number of backers between successful and unsuccessful campaigns by examining their variance and standard deviation values.

## Key Findings

### Variability (Variance and Standard Deviation):
- **Successful campaigns**:
  - **Variance**: 1,606,216.6
  - **Standard Deviation**: 1,266.243947
- **Unsuccessful campaigns**:
  - **Variance**: 924,113.455
  - **Standard Deviation**: 959.9868133

Data analysis in Excel revealed that successful campaigns have a higher variance and standard deviation compared to unsuccessful campaigns, indicating more variability in the number of backers for successful campaigns.

## Interpretation
The elevated variance and standard deviation in successful campaigns signify a more widespread distribution of backers around the average. Factors like popularity, adept promotion, or innovative project ideas could contribute to this variety. In comparison, unsuccessful campaigns, with their lower variability metrics, suggest a more homogenous set of backers.

## Notes for Excel Users
If you'd like to delve deeper into the Excel data:
1. Ensure the raw data is correctly formatted for any further analysis.
2. Utilize Excel's Data Analysis Toolpak for advanced statistical operations.
3. Visual representations, like charts or graphs, can be beneficial to better interpret the results.

## Conclusion
The disparity in the variability metrics between successful and unsuccessful campaigns underscores the diverse appeal and reach of successful campaigns. Their more pronounced variability indicates differences in outreach strategies, the inherent appeal of project ideas, or a combination of both.
