Crowdfunding platforms

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since they began in the late aughts. Everyone from indie creators to famous celebrities have utilized crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

REPORTS
To determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns, we can compare the variance and standard deviation values for both groups:
Variability (Variance and Standard Deviation):

For successful campaigns:
Variance: 1606216.6
Standard Deviation: 1266.243947
For unsuccessful campaigns:
Variance: 924113.455
Standard Deviation: 959.9868133

The variance and standard deviation for successful campaigns are higher than those for unsuccessful campaigns. This indicates that the number of backers in successful campaigns tends to vary more from the mean compared to unsuccessful campaigns.

Interpretation:
The higher variance and standard deviation for successful campaigns suggest that the number of backers for successful campaigns is more spread out from the mean, resulting in greater variability. In contrast, the lower variance and standard deviation for unsuccessful campaigns indicate that the number of backers for unsuccessful campaigns is less spread out from the mean, resulting in lower variability.

Does this make sense?
Yes, this makes sense because successful campaigns may attract a wider range of backers due to their popularity, promotion, or compelling project ideas. As a result, the number of backers can vary significantly from campaign to campaign, leading to higher variability in the data. On the other hand, unsuccessful campaigns may have fewer backers on average, resulting in a more consistent or narrower range of backers and, therefore, lower variability.
